# YouTube Channel Resources

:de: [Deutsch](./README.de.md)

I started my own [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JochenZehnder). In
this repo you will find resources from the videos and additional information.

I setup this repo to be multilingual. There are is always an english and german
`README.md` file. You can either directly open the file or use the link at the
top of each page to switch.
